# CESMII Smart Manufacturing Innovation Platform
Welcome to the CESMII SMIP Github. Navigate through the API sections to learn about and use the platform.

CESMII's Smart Manufacturing Innovation Platform™ (or SMIP™, for short) is a collection of technologies for simplifying access to manufacturing data by normalizing across protocols, enforcing a re-usable object model, and guaranteeing an interface contract for application development. These goals are implemented through the related Smart Manufacturing Profile™ (SM Profile™) project, a cooperation between OPC UA and CESMII Members, to create re-distributable and extensible Information Model that includes protocol bindings.

Once applied by an adopting platform (such as the SMIP, or other commercial offerings) the developer interface to the object model is exposed through GraphQL. These documents describe this interface, and how to build raw payloads. Efforts to develop SDKs that provide a simplified adoption path fromspecific programming languages or environments are also discussed.

## [Demos](https://github.com/cesmii/API/tree/main/Demos)
Go here for for a variety of demos used to move data to and from the SMIP using [Excel](https://github.com/cesmii/API/tree/main/Demos/Excel), [MATLAB](https://github.com/cesmii/API/tree/main/Demos/MatLab%20Request), [Simple OPCUA Server](https://github.com/cesmii/API/tree/main/Demos/Simple%20OPCUA%20Server), and more. 

There's a demo that brings together a full simulation from data collection with MQTT on a Raspberry Pi to and custom application display for a tank [here](https://github.com/cesmii/API/tree/main/Demos/Tank%20Simulator).

## GraphQL API [Documentation](https://github.com/cesmii/API/blob/main/Docs)
Start by learning about the GraphQL API. In the [Docs folder](https://github.com/cesmii/API/blob/main/Docs) you'll find documentation for the CESMII Smart Manufacturing Innovation Platform GraphQL API.
Go here to learn about the GraphQL API and how to use some basic [Queries](https://github.com/cesmii/API/blob/main/Docs/queries.md) and [Mutations](https://github.com/cesmii/API/blob/main/Docs/mutations.md)

## [Samples](https://github.com/cesmii/API/tree/main/Samples)
[Sample code](https://github.com/cesmii/API/tree/main/Samples) to show you how to do simple GraphQL requests in a few common programming languages.
