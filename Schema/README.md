# CESMII SMIP API Schema
The CESMII SMIP GraphQL API is a proposed common interface for the discovery of objects, types and their relationships. The schema itself is open, and can be implemented by any industry participant or platform provider to provide a "smart" manufacturing platform.

The schema is described as a GraphQL interface and a markdown document for reference.
